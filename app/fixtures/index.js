He`s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they`re friends, like you and me! I should`ve known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.'

    description: 'You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don`t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I`m breaking now. We said we`d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn`t. Nature is lethal but it doesn`t hold a candle to man.'

    description: 'Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that`s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you`re in a toy store, because you`re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.'
